########## plotResidual ##########

Function: Generate residuals from .root files in a given folder.

Inputs/Execution:

Called from command line as follows:

$ python plotResidual.py folder_name <file_name>

folder_name: folder in which root files are contained
file_name: output filename (an optional parameter)

The program will iterate over all root files in the program and create a plot of residuals (EV - MC) for x, y, z, ke for each
root file. The residuals will be stored in a file called file_name.root. If no name was supplied for this argument, they will 
be stored in a file called residuals.root.

WARNING:
plotResidual.py should not receive its own folder as an argument (i.e. never called like python plotResidual.py ./)
This is because the file creates a root file which will then itself be iterated over. This results in a segmentation 
fault as this root file is not what the program is intended to work with.

Output:
residuals.root: Output file of root residuals. 4 residuals for each input file (x, y, z, ke) 
json_files: Output folder containing bias/resolution information for each root file iterated over. Files will be 
saved as "root_filename.root", i.e. if the file being iterated over was x0y0z2500.root the json file will be 
x0y0z2500.json. These are the files that will be used by the later programs. 

Note that running plotResidual.py will cause the json_files folder to be emptied if it exists already. Therefore if 
json files are neeed for later use, they should be copied/moved to a separate folder.
