######### multifits ##########

Function: Produce plots of position vs resolution/bias with all polynomial fits (degree 2-9) displayed simultaneously. 

Inputs/Execution:

This file does not have a main method, so it must be executed using ROOT. It can be called like this:

.x multifits.cc(std::string var)

var: The variable whose plots are to be generated. Can be either x, y, or z.

Output: This produces one file "MultipleFits_var1.root", where var1 is the variable given in the initial call. This file
	contains all the plots produced by this file. If a file of the same name exists, it is overwritten.
