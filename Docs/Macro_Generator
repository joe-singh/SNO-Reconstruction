########## Macro_Generator.py ###########

Function: Generate rat macros for simulations along a range of positions.

Inputs/Execution: 
Called from command line, for example:

$ python Macro_Generator.py input_file

Input file must be a .txt file containing the parameters for the simulation macros. It must have a format like this:

xmin 0
xmax 0 
xstep 0
ymin 0
ymax 0
ystep 0
zmin -5500
zmax 5500
zstep 500
kemin 3
kemax 3
kestep 0
runs 10000
filepath /data/snoplus/home/joesingh/snoing/PMTData/3MeV

Note the file must not have a blank first or last line, i.e. each file should have only 13 lines. 

Output:
The file will produce macros as governed by the input file's parameters. The above example would produce macros for 
simulations ranging from (0, 0, -5500) to (0, 0, 5500) in steps of 500. Each macro will have 10000 runs at an energy of 3 MeV. 

At present only one variable can be changed, i.e. 2 out of 3 step variables must be 0 and for those variables the min
and max must be the same. 

The macros produced for the given variable are put in a folder called either x_Macros, y_Macros, or z_Macros depending on
which variable is being simulated over. These folders are placed in the location given by filepath. 

BUG:
At present the first call to Macro_Generator.py will create macro files at (0, 0, 0) in all three folders even though other
macros are properly outputted into the correct folder. This does not cause any functional issues but may be something to 
check for if this program or a subsequent one starts misbehaving.
